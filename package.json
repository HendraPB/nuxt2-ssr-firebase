  "description": "Use Firebase function as server to render Nuxt project SSR mode with various features in it. I took the Nuxt Firebase SSR template from https://github.com/atoka-tech/nuxt-firebase-ssr and Nuxt project from https://github.com/muhibbudins/nuxt-project as proof if the template doesn't only work on projects that are used but also on projects that use the nuxt feature is quite complete. In this project I will also try the template using Latest Nuxt version ie 2.3.4",
